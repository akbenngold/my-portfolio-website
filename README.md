## Figma Design

The design for this portfolio website was created using Figma. You can view the design and make comments by following this link: [Figma Design](<https://www.figma.com/file/8zCTL3SGyD1Eq1QcLcH2UN/Portfolio-Full-Website-design-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=BSW9W31u8TYu4Xkx-0>).

## BEM Methodology

This project follows the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for naming CSS classes. BEM helps maintain a clean and structured codebase by providing a standardized naming convention for CSS classes.

## 7-1 CSS Architecture

The CSS architecture of this project follows the 7-1 pattern, also known as the 7-1 CSS architecture. This architecture divides the stylesheets into seven different directories for partial Sass files and one main Sass file for importing all partials. It provides a scalable and modular approach to organizing stylesheets.

## Root Font Size

The root font size in the HTML has been set to `62.5%`, which means `1rem` is equivalent to `10px`. This makes calculations easier as `rem` units are based on the root font size.
