About 
I'm a passionate frontend developer with experience crafting user-centric web applications. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I specialize in creating responsive, intuitive interfaces that enhance user experience. 
My expertise extends to modern frameworks and libraries such as React, Redux, Vue, Tailwind, Sass where I've led successful projects from concept to deployment. I have a keen eye for design and a commitment to clean, maintainable code. My experience in technical writing enables me to write clear and comprehensive documentation. I thrive in collaborative environments where innovation and creativity drive results. 
Let's build something remarkable together.


<!------ main about me ----->
Frontend developer, technical writer. 

Technology has always fascinated me and understanding how it works under the hood intrigues me more. 
I have a constant curiosity about the creation process and underlying principles behind various technologies I encounter and I've not hesitated to learn about them. 

From No-code Development to Data Analytics to Quality Assurance to Technical Writing to Web Design to Web Development. Everything I have done, small or big, has been a vital stepping stone for where I am today.
Web Development is my canvas and I delight in it because of the thrill of creating interfaces that seamlessly adapt to different devices and screen sizes ensuring a consistent and enjoyable user experience across all platforms is incredibly satisfying. Additionally, I relish the opportunity to bring static designs to life through interactive elements and subtle animations, ensuring smooth transitions, cresting journeys that effortlessly guide users towards their goals, optimizing performance, user authentication etc. 
I am dedicated to creating solutions that address the needs of both users and clients.

The guiding principle I live by generally is "Keep it Simple" 
Just like Antoine de Saint-Exupéry said:

"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

This quote emphasizes the importance of simplicity and effectiveness in design and creation. It speaks to the idea that true excellence is not about adding more complexity, but rather about stripping away the unnecessary until only the essential remains. This resonates deeply with my philosophy of focusing on what truly matters and avoiding doing things for the sake of doing them.
I want to add value to the world and add it well in whatever I do. 

Outside the digital realm, you'll often find me indulging in my diverse interests. Reading deeply about healthcare, listening to all genres of good music and being a good cook — I experiment with different flavors and techniques.
